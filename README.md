# Brick Breaker Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Brick Breaker game created using Java. Brick Breaker is a game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the screen.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally.
   - Press the space bar to launch the ball at the beginning of the game and to release the ball from the paddle during gameplay.

2. **Objective**:
   - The objective of the game is to break all the bricks at the top of the screen using the ball and paddle.
   - Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears, and the player earns points.
   - If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends.

3. **Game Elements (Upcoming)**:
   - **Paddle**: The paddle moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen and is controlled by the player.
   - **Ball**: The ball bounces around the screen and breaks bricks upon collision.
   - **Bricks**: Bricks are arranged at the top of the screen. When hit by the ball, they disappear.
   - **Power-ups**: Some versions of the game may include power-ups that affect the gameplay, such as increasing the size of the paddle, providing extra lives, or adding a second ball.
